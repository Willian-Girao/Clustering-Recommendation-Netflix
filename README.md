# Machine Learning Tecniques for Clustering and General Data Analysis

Content currently contains user **rating predictions**  and **movie similarity predictions** built utilizing two clustering tecniques (Knn and Kmeans) on the famous Netflix dataset. 

Problem modeling, dataset pre-processing and experiments descriptions and analysis/interpretations for the first run of experiments are presented in the form of an paper on the [link](https://github.com/Willian-Girao/Clustering-Recommendation-Netflix/blob/master/kmeans_knn_ratingPrediction_moviePrediction_analysis_000/relatorio_dinal.pdf).
